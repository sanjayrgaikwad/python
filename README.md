## About

Relative Strength Index written in Python. The whole point of this application is to be able to come up with a list of as many different types of stocks (stock tickers) that you want to screen and see if it meets the Relative Strength criteria. A combination of the RSI and the 20 and 200 day Moving Average (MA) tend to be strong and popular indicators to determine the future behavior of a stock.

At the end of pulling stock data, a table is shown displaying metrics of the stocks pulled along with a link to view the chart.
